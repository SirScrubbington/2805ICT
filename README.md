# Python Minesweeper
## Major project for 2805ICT, Principles of Software Engineering.
### Developed by Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://twitter.com/SirScrubbington))

## Description
Python Minesweeper is a minesweeper application, written in python using pygame, tkinter and sqlite. 
It was developed in my second year of university for 2805ICT, Principles of Software Engineering as 
the major assignment, over a number of weeks of work. It originally started as a PHP application, as 
I was not fully familiar with Python however I used the application to learn more about how to use it.

This is a legacy repository, which will no longer be updated or maintained.
